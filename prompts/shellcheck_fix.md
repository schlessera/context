I have a shell script with the following shellcheck issues:

{{{1}}}

Here's the current content of the script:

```bash
{{{2}}}
```

Please provide fixes for these issues, explaining each fix.
Format your response as a series of suggestions in markdown, each starting with a new heading '## Suggestion: '
followed by the explanation in a separate paragraph and then the fixed code snippet.
Output the fixed code snippet as a code block of type 'patch'.
The patch should be in the unified diff format, starting with '--- a/script' and '+++ b/script' headers,
followed by one or more hunks. Each hunk should start with '@@ -line,count +line,count @@'.
Ensure the patch can be applied to the original script without any offset.
Do not include any preceding text or paragraph before the code snippet.
The full output will only contain one heading and one paragraph for each suggestion, as well as
one code block with the patch, no other text.
Ensure each suggestion is clearly separated.
